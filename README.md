League Of Silence is a simple RPG game for command line interface. 
This is piliot version and experiment by two junior programmers to 
seek fine design pattern for their further game-dev. All the out-put 
features only rely on command-line text based for now, however, 
additional features such as sounds or simple GUI may be added later.


Game Concept : Advanture, Victoria Age, Steam Power!
====================================================
TheDizzler would introduce this later! ;)
