2014/06/14
==========
-   A module - error_handlers is added. Errors of every modules may be
    handled with this module. 'monsters/OUTLINE' is updated. Test 
    script for testing 'error_handlers' module is added into 'tests' 
    module.  

-   The previous error handling mechanism for monsters/MTDescription 
    is replaced with new one - handling errors by 'error_handlers' 
    module. An issue that has possible to redendantly call 
    MTDescription.GET() method from describe() of Monster class is 
    fixed for better performance. A member variable of Monster class 
    holds a description from MTDescription.GET() method now. Related 
    few minor issues are updated.

==========
-   Miner fixes at lgdofslnc/tests/TestMonsters.java - unnecessary 
    redundancies are erased for better performance.

==========
    -   Recovered broken format of previous merging with 
        origin/master.
    -   Finalized src name package issue. Root package is NO LONGER 
        src. Every package name begins its own directory name within 
        'src/' as their root name. 
    -   Updated monsters/OUTLINE. 
    -   MTDescriptionInterface is added. All descriptions of monsters 
        are moved to there.
    -   Interface name MonsterIndex is replaced to MTIndexInterface. 
        Its index name is also changed. Now all  monster index names 
        begin with MTI_ instead of MI_.  
    -   MTDescription class is added. Now describe() method of Monster 
        class refers this class to print a monster description. A file
        los_error_numbers.ref is added at lgndofslnc/reference/ 
        directory to log all the error numbers of LoS within there. 
    -   MTD_ERROR_MESSAGE constant is added into 
        MTDescriptionInterface.
