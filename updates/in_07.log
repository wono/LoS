2014/07/10
==========
-   A file 'monsters/Monster.java' is updated. Now monster can die.

-   A file 'Combat.java' is added at 'controllers/'.

-   A test file 'Simulator.java' is updated. Now it has a basic combat 
    flow. Minor changes are modified.


2014/07/09
==========
-   An interface 'Dialogue.java' is added at 'controllers/interfaces/'.

-   A test file 'Simulator.java' is updated. Now it promts attack/run 
    if a monster exists at a room.
    
-   A test file 'TestMonsters.java' is updated to test monsters with 
    rooms.


2014/07/08
==========
-   A new test file Simuloator.java is added. Overall game flow as a 
    junction of multiple modules will be tested here. Minor issues are 
    fixed.


2014/07/06
==========
-   A new file 'Map.java' is added at 'maps' module. It is abstract 
    class that enables to set room locations of a map from external 
    xml data read within its child classes. Each child class 
    represents each stage of the game map.
    
-   A file 'Relation.java' is moved into 'maps/types' from 'maps/'.

-   A enumeration file 'Directions.java' is added at 'maps/types'. It 
    represents rooms that are availabe to move from each room of a 
    map. It may be used as prompting user key commands later on.
    
-   A new library 'WConsume.java' is added. WConsume is a set of 
    static generic methods that is mixture of the standard functional 
    interface - Consumer with other standard functional interfaces to 
    simply manipulate code that have particular patterns with the 
    lambda expressions.
    
-   A file 'controllers/Direction.java' is updated. Now it has a 
    feature that moving arround rooms with directions specified by 
    user input.
    
-   A file 'Control.java' is added at 'controllers' module. It has a 
    static generic method to manipulate basic moving control flow 
    among objects. 


2014/07/05
==========
-   A file 'Map1.java' is added at 'maps' module. The external data 
    from 'RecordMaps.xml' is combined, and each room location is set 
    up there as a Stage 1 (Map 1) of game.


2014/07/04
==========
-   A file - 'monsters/RandomMonsterGen.java' is modified. Not it has 
    probability of returning null in case that a room has no monster.
    
-   A file 'maps/Room.java' is modified. Now it has a chance to 
    generate randomized monster within each it's instance. It has also 
    feature to set or erase (in case of assigning null) a monster 
    object manually. Format of the source code is also changed.
    
-   A library file 'WProces.java' is added. This file has a static 
    generic method being used with lambda expressions for better 
    code-reusability. 
    

2014/07/03
==========
-   Test files - 'DemoItems.java' and 'DemoMaps.java' are modified. 
    Now they use aggretate operations with lambda expressions istead 
    of iterators. Minor chages are updated.

-   Formats of record file - 'RecordMaps.xml' is modified.

-   The module - 'maps' is upgraded. Now it has a feature linking with 
    other rooms as its directions (north, south, east, west). Its test 
    file - DemoMaps.java is also updated.


2014/07/02
==========
-   A new module - 'maps' is added. A file 'Room.java' is moved into 
    'maps' from 'chambers'. A file - 'maps/RoomList.java' is added. 

-   A library file - 'RecordPath.java' is added to more easily get xml 
    record file path when writing test files. A test file - 
    'DemoMaps.java' is added to test 'maps' module. Minor chages are 
    updated.


2014/07/01
==========
-   A feature tesing 'items' module is added at 'Makefile'. Minor 
    modification are added there.

-   A new module - 'items' is added. A xml record file - 
    'recordItems.xml' is added. A test file - 'DemoItems.java' is 
    added to test them. Minor changes are updated.
