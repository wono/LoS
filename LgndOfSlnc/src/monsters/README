Module Dev Progress
===================
2014/06/12
    -   Recovered broken format of previous merging with 
        origin/master.
    -   Finalized src name package issue. Root package is NO LONGER 
        src. Every package name begins its own directory name within 
        'src/' as their root name. 
    -   Updated monsters/OUTLINE. 
    -   MTDescriptionInterface is added. All descriptions of monsters 
        are moved to there.
    -   Interface name MonsterIndex is replaced to MTIndexInterface. 
        Its index name is also changed. Now all  monster index names 
        begin with MTI_ instead of MI_.  
    -   MTDescription class is added. Now describe() method of Monster 
        class refers this class to print a monster description. A file
        los_error_numbers.ref is added at lgndofslnc/reference/ 
        directory to log all the error numbers of LoS within there. 
    -   MTD_ERROR_MESSAGE constant is added into 
        MTDescriptionInterface.
    -   Test module is upgraded. Several minor issues are fixed.
