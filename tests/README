(tests/logs/*) to show result and error of each test. GNU Nano editor 
is used to open these log files. The followings are commands for 
testing on the command line shell:

Commands For Testing

Testing error_handlers:
    LoSA/$> make test_error_handlers

Testing monsters:
    LoSA/$> make test_monsters
